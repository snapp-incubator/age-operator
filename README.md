# Age-Operator
This repository is a secret manager for kubernetes using [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age).

### What is secret manager?
By default, you put all your configuration on a codebase. There may be sensitive data like passwords or tokens among them. a secret manager lets you encrypt your sensitive data and then push it to codebase.

## Description
Instead of pushing raw data to git, encrypt your data, push it to codebase, apply it to kubernetes using gitops, and kubernetes will use this operator to create a [secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) for you. then you can use that secret for your deployments.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

## Step-by-Step guide through using age-operator

### Age CLI Installation

You can use [this link](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age#installation) to install `age`. Also, you can build from source if you have a supported version of golang installed on your system. It's mentioned in the given link.

### Generate Age Keys

You need to  generate `age keys` by running the code below simply:

```sh
age-keygen -o {key file name}
# For example
age-keygen -o key.txt
```

If you look inside the file, it has three lines.

```text
# created: 2022-xx-yyT00:00:00+04:30
# public key: age1fjn89y8svr9rdqh6c9h6drxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
AGE-SECRET-KEY-1ZQ3729NNAAP8MAFXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- The first line shows the creation timestamp of the Age key.
- The second line is the public key. It's used to encrypt data.
- The third line is the secret key. It's used to create an AgeKey object that decrypts the AgeSecret object.

### Encryption with Age

For encryption, you will need a `public key` and a file that contains your sensitive data. your yaml data should be flat. nested yaml files are not supported now.

sample data.yaml:

```yaml
password: my_password
token: my_token
```

and then run:

```sh
age -r {public key} -e -a {plaintext data file} > {encrypted data file}
# for example
age -r age1fjn89y8svr9rdqh6c9h6drxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -e -a data.yaml > data.age
```

If you look at the `data.age` file, it contains data like this (surely content differs).

```text
-----BEGIN AGE ENCRYPTED FILE-----

-----END AGE ENCRYPTED FILE-----
```

### Decryption with Age

To decrypt data, you will need a `secret key` and an encrypted file.

```sh
age -d -i {secret key file} {encrypted data file}
# For example
age -d -i key.txt data.age
```

## Kubernetes Resources

### AgeKey object

To create an `AgeKey` object, you need to create a template similar to the following.

```yaml
apiVersion: gitopssecret.snappcloud.io/v1alpha1
kind: AgeKey
metadata:
    name: {fill name}
    namespace: {fill namespace}
spec:
    ageSecretKey: {fill with secret key}
```

Here is an `AgeKey` sample:

```bash
oc get AgeKey agekey-sample -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: gitopssecret.snappcloud.io/v1alpha1
kind: AgeKey
metadata:
  name: agekey-sample
  namespace: default
spec:
  ageSecretKey: "AGE-SECRET-KEY-1ZQ3729NNAAP8MAFXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

### AgeSecret object

You can create an `AgeSecret` object with the below template. You can find more information about each field in the [AgeSecret Fields](./secret-management.md#agesecret) section:

```yaml
apiVersion: gitopssecret.snappcloud.io/v1alpha1
kind: AgeSecret
metadata:
    name: {fill name}
    namespace: {fill namespace}
    labels:
        ... {fill labels}
    annotations:
        ... {fill annotations}
spec:
    labelsToRemove:
      - {label1}
      - {label2}
    suspend: {fill suspend}
    ageKeyRef: {fill ref name}
    stringData:
        ... {fill stringData}
```

#### AgeSecret

- <h5>name</h5> Name of the AgeSecret object. If the decryption process was successful, the controller will generate a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">Secret</a> object with this name.

- <h5>namespace</h5>
  The namespace of the AgeSecret object, the secret will get created in this namespace.

- <h5>labels</h5>
  A set of "key:value" that will be <b>copied inside the generated secret</b>.

- <h5>annotations</h5>
  A set of "key:value" that will be <b>copied inside the generated secret</b>.

- <h5>labelsToRemove</h5>
  An array of labels to remove while creating the child secret, and not to inherit them. Sample use-case is inside CD on k8s, when you want a label selector to track "AgeSecret" but not the child secret.

- <h5>suspend</h5>
  It's boolean. The default value is <b>false</b>. It determines whether the controller should reconcile on changes and apply changes to secret or you are just testing and the controller should not change anything.

- <h5>ageKeyRef</h5>
  This field indicates the name of the AgeKey object that you have encrypted this AgeSecret with it, so it has to be the same as the "AgeKey metadata.name" field's value.

- <h5>stringData</h5>
  This field is where you should put the encrypted Age message without its "-----BEGIN AGE ENCRYPTED FILE-----" prefix and "-----END AGE ENCRYPTED FILE-----" suffix.

> [!NOTE]
> Be careful not to push files containing "secret key" or "plain configuration" on git during the encryption and decryption steps.

Here is an `AgeSecret` sample:

```bash
oc get AgeSecret agesecret-sample -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: gitopssecret.snappcloud.io/v1alpha1
kind: AgeSecret
metadata:
  name: agesecret-sample
  namespace: test-age-secret
  labels:
    key_label: value_label
  annotations:
    key_annotation: value_annotation
spec:
  suspend: false
  ageKeyRef: agekey-sample
  stringData: |

## Installation

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/gitops-secret-manager:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/gitops-secret-manager:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
After forking this repository, add your code and add tests for your code. then make sure that test cases are alright.

```sh
make test

# to test api with verbosity
make test-api

# to test controller with verbosity
make test-controller
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

And in case you don't want to enable webhook in local, run command below and comment [WEBHOOK] sections in config/crd.

```sh
make run ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
